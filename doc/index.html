<p>E-commerce site. Uses <code>bcrypt</code> and <code>materialize</code>.
There&#39;s a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions,
I&#39;ll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.</p>

<p>To set up:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>rake db:setup</code></p>
</li><li>
<p>Sorry, didn&#39;t get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a
few bugs.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Went to Bali</p>

<p>Objective</p>

<p>The objective of Went to Bali was to take an existing codebase and refactor
the code, add additional features and fix any bugs found in the software.
It is the first time that the coursework has requested the refactor of an
existing set of code rather than simply creating one&#39;s own project from
scratch.</p>

<p>Description</p>

<p>Went to Bali will allow the user to log in as either an new user or an
admin, and if an account does not currently exist, create a new one. From
there, the user can add fictional items to a shopping cart and check out,
clearing their basket and adding their order to their order history. As an
admin, the user can add new products to the site, or edit existing
products, and in doing so, add images to the products using the paperclip
gem to store the images in a database.</p>

<p>Technologies Used</p>

<p>This site was made in Ruby-on-Rails base, with several additional Gem
installed, as well as a Postgres database with an ActiveRecord controller.</p>

<p>Setup</p>

<p>From the command line, navigate to the desired folder run git clone <a
href="https://github.com/kenr16/went-to-bali-mwahaha">github.com/kenr16/went-to-bali-mwahaha</a>
bundle install Start Postgres server rake db:create rake db:migrate rake
db:seed to populate the site rails s Open browser and navigate to <a
href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ Specifications:</p>

<p>Required AJAX tasks:</p>

<p>AJAX applied to adding items &amp; updating total number of items on index
page. AJAX applied to show&amp;hide product details; product detail
includes an image. AJAX applied to deleting items from the shopping cart
&amp; updating total price. Refactored &amp; tested:</p>

<p>Ensure that users can&#39;t order a negative number of items. Add flash
messages for signing up, signing in and signing out. Add validations to all
models. Fix row height for products. Add product update and delete
functionality for admins. Add further AJAX functionality to Admin CRUD.
Technologies Used</p>

<p>HTML CSS, Bootstrap, SASS Materialize JavaScript Ruby Rails Faker Postgres
PSQL ActiveRecord bcrypt Support and contact details</p>
